        "# Automating peptide/immunogen analyses for antibody eligibility using **Selenium**\n",
        "by mack hepker\n",
        "\n",
        "June 2024\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Selecting an antibody for your immunohistochemistry (IHC) or immunofluorescence (IF) study can be overwhelming -- especially when considering all of the factors that play into an antibody's affinity for binding, including variable chemical properties of the tissue sample, the protein of interest, and your protocol reagents.\n",
        "\n",
        "These factors may be overlooked when selecting an antibody, especially when trying to account for the diversity of antibodies on the market for an individual protein of interest, each with their own properties to toss into the ring. This likely contributes to the reputation of IHC/IF for being fickle, especially in longer-fix tissue (e.g. human, non-human primate, and other species of intrigue outside the realm of highly controlled lab animal models). Alternatively, it may feel prudent to avoid using a given antibody unless it has been previously validated in similar tissue, either through word of mouth or publication.\n",
        "\n",
        "Antibodies are often validated by the vendor with basic and clinical research in mind, wherein laboratory animal tissue is quickly processed after death. Typically, there is little further testing or acknowledgment of an antibody's binding efficacy in tissue put through variable post-mortem processing conditions, which can (and very much do) impact **1)** the structure of the protein of interest and **2)** the accessibility of the protein of interest, both of which are inherent to the antibody's ability to bind to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most antibodies are made against human protein sequences for use in rapid-fix rodent tissue with minimal processing that would distort the molecular composition of the tissue. Therefore, the immunogen / peptide sequence is assuredly homologous between a human and the animal model (e.g. mouse).\n",
        "\n",
        "Often, the immunogen is a *subset* of the peptide of interest, either because that subset is homologous between species (whereas other sections of the peptide are not); that particular domain is more amenable to antibody binding (ex. extracellular, therefore exposed); or it is a more hydrophilic in its amino acid composition (turning it outward towards the antibody solution, where it can be accessed). Immunogens corresponding to the entirety of a peptide sequence may be less IHC-friendly -- smaller peptides better permeate cell membranes and wayward fixative cross-links.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**It is important, and relatively simple, to take steps to best ensure that an antibody will similarly work with your method and range of samples.**\n",
        "\n",
        "* This includes ensuring the immunogen -- derived from human, mouse, or rat protein sequences -- is homologous across all of your species of interest. Alternatively, you can know whether to use a certain marker to evaluate protein expression in *some,* but not other, species of interest--a low (< 65 %) homology inhibits or precludes the ability of the antibody to bind to the protein in that species, whether or not the protein is present.\n",
        "\n",
        "* This also includes obtaining information about the cellular location of the peptide immunogen. Nuclear and intracellular domains may benefit more from increased membrane-permeabilization measures in your protocol; transmembrane receptors may benefit from less.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Finally, obtaining essential properties of the immunogen peptide sequence, such as hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity ratio, isoelectric point, and net charge at pH 7.0.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, we automate these steps using the popular Selenium web-scraping tool, available as a Python package. Selenium can be run from the command line, a Google Colab notebook (such as this) or Jupyter notebook, a Python IDE, ChatGPT, or any other interface where Python is installed and accessible. We will use peptide sequence (AAs) and desired parameters as input, and amend them to a document for your reference when making your purchasing and protocol decisions. These steps may also be conducted manually, or separately given a peptide sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Outline\n",
        "\n",
        "1) Obtain immunogen sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Check for % homology across species of interest (ex. using NCBI Protein BLAST).\n",
        "* > Greater than 75% homology is ideal to avoid false negative staining in your species of interest. < 50% homology is necessary to assure no cross-reactivity (this is especially important to look out for, as your peptide sequence may be somewhat similar to pieces of other proteins, resulting in false positive staining).\n",
